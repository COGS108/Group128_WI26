To monitor indications such as depression symptoms, anxiety, stress, sense of belonging, and usage of counseling  service, campuses use standardized survey tools. However, different campuses measure mental health and well-being in different ways.

    "One of the most widely used systems for comparing mental health status in US colleges and universities is the Healthy Minds Study (HMS).The study surveyed students at participating institutions and reported prevalence rates of mental health indicators, help-seeking behaviors, and demand for services.Results from HMS indicate that mental health challenges are common among US college students. More importantly, the study shows a consistent gap between the number of students experiencing mental health difficulties and the number who actually seek treatment. This suggests that differences between campuses may reflect variations in access to care, stigma, or awareness, rather than differences in mental health alone.\n",

    "This is one of the largest and most comprehensive surveys of college student health in the United States. Conducted over multiple years across numerous institutions, the reference group summaries released by ACHA enable colleges to compare their student data against national benchmarks. These summaries encompass assessment metrics related to mental health, well-being, sense of belonging, and health behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research results indicate that well-being is influenced both by mental health status and by broader campus experiences, such as a sense of belonging and perceptions of institutional support. This supports a perspective that views well-being as multidimensional rather than solely focused on mental health symptoms.\n",
