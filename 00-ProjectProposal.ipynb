    "Students' mental health has become a central concern in the field of higher education, because psychological distress affects not only students' quality of life, but also their academic performance and their behaviors to seek help. To monitor indications such as depression symptoms, anxiety, stress, sense of belonging, and usage of counseling  service, campuses use standardized survey tools. However, different campuses measure mental health and well-being in different ways. As a result, we must carefully design metric selection and consider survey design variation, including sampling strategies, response rates and timing within a academic year, these are necessary for the studies.\n",

    "One of the most widely used systems for comparing mental health status in US colleges and universities is the Healthy Minds Study (HMS).The study surveyed students at participating institutions and reported prevalence rates of mental health indicators, help-seeking behaviors, and demand for services.Results from HMS indicate that mental health challenges are common among US college students. More importantly, the study shows a consistent gap between the number of students experiencing mental health difficulties and the number who actually seek treatment. This suggests that differences between campuses may reflect variations in access to care, stigma, or awareness, rather than differences in mental health alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, prior work also notes that self-reported mental health measures may be influenced by response bias, campus culture, and differences in survey participation rates. As a result, higher reported prevalence at some campuses may reflect greater awareness or willingness to disclose symptoms rather than worse underlying mental health.\n",

    "\n",
    "Research results indicate that well-being is influenced both by mental health status and by broader campus experiences, such as a sense of belonging and perceptions of institutional support. This supports a perspective that views well-being as multidimensional rather than solely focused on mental health symptoms.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there is a statistically significant difference in student mental well-being between UC San Diego and other UC campuses as well as U.S. universities overall, as measured by standardized indicators such as self-reported stress levels and happiness. Specifically, we predict that UC San Diego students will report comparable or slightly higher levels of psychological distress relative to peer institutions, reflecting differences in academic workload, campus culture, and perceived support systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is motivated by prior findings from large-scale surveys such as the Healthy Minds Study and ACHA-NCHA, which suggest that institutional characteristics and campus environments can meaningfully influence student mental health outcomes. We further expect that observed differences may reflect not only underlying mental health status, but also variation in awareness, willingness to disclose symptoms, and access to mental health resources across campuses."

    "For this project, we are not collecting our own survey data. Instead, we are using established campus and national survey sources that already measure student well-being using standardized questions. This matters for our research question because it lets us compare UC San Diego to other UC campuses and to broader U.S. benchmarks without inventing a new measurement scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Ideal dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, we would have a single dataset that includes multiple universities (UCSD, other UC campuses, and a wide range of U.S. schools) and measures mental well-being with the exact same survey items, administered during the same time window each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables we would want:**\n",
    "- Campus identifier (UCSD vs other UC campuses vs non-UC U.S. universities)\n",
    "- Well-being outcomes: self-reported stress, anxiety/depression indicators, self-reported happiness or life satisfaction, and sense of belonging\n",
    "- Help-seeking / resource use: whether a student used counseling/mental health services and perceived access/barriers\n",
    "- Timing variables: quarter/semester timing and survey administration window (so we can check whether “finals season” effects are showing up)\n",
    "- Basic controls: year in school, age range, gender (if available), major/college (if available), and financial stress indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many observations:**\n",
    "To make cross-campus comparisons stable, we would want at least a few hundred responses per campus, and ideally 1,000+ per campus when possible. If sample sizes vary by campus, we would prefer weighted estimates or to focus comparisons on campuses with enough responses to avoid noisy results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the data would be collected:**\n",
    "The cleanest design would be a standardized, anonymous online survey administered to representative samples across campuses at the same point in the academic year. Ideally, campuses would use the same validated scales so that differences reflect real student experiences rather than differences in survey wording.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the data would be stored/organized:**\n",
    "We would store the data in a tidy, tabular format where each row is one respondent and each column is one variable. If we only have campus-level summaries, the dataset would instead have one row per campus per year with summary statistics.\n",

    "**2) Real datasets we will use**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Healthy Minds Study (HMS), 2024–2025 National Data Report**\n",
    "HMS provides national data on student mental health and help-seeking patterns. We will use it to benchmark UCSD and the UC system against broader U.S. college patterns. Key variables include stress/distress measures and help-seeking behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ACHA–NCHA (Spring 2025 reference summaries)**\n",
    "ACHA–NCHA provides standardized college health survey metrics across many institutions. We will use it for national and reference group comparisons. Important variables include mental health indicators and well-being measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UC Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES)**\n",
    "UCUES is designed specifically for cross-campus comparison within the UC system. This will be our primary dataset for comparing UCSD to other UC campuses on self-reported well-being and stress. We prioritize UCUES because it reduces measurement inconsistency across campuses.\n"

    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [x] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We use data from surveys already conducted by universities or research organizations. Those surveys include their own consent process. We only use published or aggregated results and do not collect new responses\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "   \n",
    "    These surveys are voluntary, so students experiencing more stress or who care more about mental health may be more likely to respond. This could make distress appear higher than the true campus average.\n",
    " - [x] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "    Limit PII exposure: We are not using identifiable student data. The reports we reference are anonymized or aggregated. Our focus is on campus-level trends rather than individuals.\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "   \n",
    "      Self-reported surveys depend on perception and willingness to share. Differences across campuses may reflect awareness or stigma, not only actual mental health differences.\n",
    " - [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "      We will avoid exaggerating small differences and describe patterns rather than ranking campuses.\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [x] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "       We will cite all public sources so others can trace where numbers come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
