    "Students' mental health has become a central concern in the field of higher education, because psychological distress affects not only students' quality of life, but also their academic performance and their behaviors to seek help. To monitor indications such as depression symptoms, anxiety, stress, sense of belonging, and usage of counseling  service, campuses use standardized survey tools. However, different campuses measure mental health and well-being in different ways. As a result, we must carefully design metric selection and consider survey design variation, including sampling strategies, response rates and timing within a academic year, these are necessary for the studies.\n",

    "This project will focus on asking how UCSD students' mental well-being and overall happiness compare to other UC campuses, other US universities, and univeristy internationlly.

    "One of the most widely used systems for comparing mental health status in US colleges and universities is the Healthy Minds Study (HMS).The study surveyed students at participating institutions and reported prevalence rates of mental health indicators, help-seeking behaviors, and demand for services.Results from HMS indicate that mental health challenges are common among US college students. More importantly, the study shows a consistent gap between the number of students experiencing mental health difficulties and the number who actually seek treatment. This suggests that differences between campuses may reflect variations in access to care, stigma, or awareness, rather than differences in mental health alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, prior work also notes that self-reported mental health measures may be influenced by response bias, campus culture, and differences in survey participation rates. As a result, higher reported prevalence at some campuses may reflect greater awareness or willingness to disclose symptoms rather than worse underlying mental health.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there is a statistically significant difference in student mental well-being between UC San Diego and other UC campuses as well as U.S. universities overall, as measured by standardized indicators such as self-reported stress levels and happiness. Specifically, we predict that UC San Diego students will report comparable or slightly higher levels of psychological distress relative to peer institutions, reflecting differences in academic workload, campus culture, and perceived support systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is motivated by prior findings from large-scale surveys such as the Healthy Minds Study and ACHA-NCHA, which suggest that institutional characteristics and campus environments can meaningfully influence student mental health outcomes. We further expect that observed differences may reflect not only underlying mental health status, but also variation in awareness, willingness to disclose symptoms, and access to mental health resources across campuses."

    "## Data"

  {
   "attachments": {},
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
"source": [
"For this project, we are not collecting our own survey data. Instead, we rely on existing student well-being surveys that universities already administer. Using these sources makes more sense for our question because they use consistent questions and larger samples, which allows for comparison across campuses. Since we are still in the proposal stage and do not yet have access to raw data, this section focuses on what data would be ideal and what sources we realistically expect to use.\n",
"\n",
"1) Ideal dataset\n",
"\n",
"In an ideal scenario, we would have one shared dataset that includes UCSD, other UC campuses, and a range of U.S. universities, all answering the same well-being questions at roughly the same time of year. That would reduce problems caused by different survey timing or different question wording, which can make comparisons less fair.\n",
"\n",
"The main variables we would want include a campus identifier, measures of stress, anxiety or depression indicators, self-reported happiness or life satisfaction, and sense of belonging. It would also help to know whether students used counseling services or felt they could access support. Some basic background variables like year in school or general age range would help with comparisons, even if we do not analyze them in depth.\n",
"\n",
"For sample size, a few hundred students per campus would be the minimum for stable estimates, but closer to 1,000 per campus would be better. If some campuses have much smaller samples, we would be cautious about drawing strong conclusions and would treat those results as more descriptive.\n",
"\n",
"These data would ideally come from anonymous online surveys given to students across campuses. Keeping the survey anonymous encourages more honest responses about mental health and reduces pressure to answer in a socially desirable way.\n",
"\n",
"In terms of structure, the data would be organized in a table where each row is one student and each column is one variable. If only campus-level summaries are available, then each row would represent a campus with average scores or percentages instead of individual responses.\n",
"\n",
"2) Real datasets we will use\n",
"\n",
"The Healthy Minds Study (HMS) national reports provide large-scale information on student mental health and help-seeking. We plan to use these reports to understand national patterns and to compare UCSD to broader trends. The most useful parts for us are the stress and mental health indicators and information about whether students seek support.\n",
"\n",
"The ACHA–NCHA summaries are another useful reference because many universities participate in them. They include mental health and well-being measures and allow schools to compare themselves to reference groups. We mainly use these for general comparison context rather than precise campus-to-campus matching.\n",
"\n",
"For UC-to-UC comparisons, the UC Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES) is the most relevant source. Since it is designed for comparisons within the UC system, the questions are more consistent across campuses. This makes it more appropriate for comparing UCSD to other UC schools.\n",
"\n",
"One limitation of using these sources is that they are self-reported surveys, which means responses depend on how students interpret questions and how comfortable they feel sharing. Response rates can also vary by campus, which may affect how representative the results are. Because of this, our goal is to describe patterns rather than claim strict causal conclusions.\n",
"\n",
"Overall, our methodological approach is to use the most comparable survey sources available and to be cautious when interpreting differences across campuses. We treat this project as a descriptive comparison rather than a predictive or diagnostic study.\n"

<<<<<<< HEAD
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Extra attention needs to be paid towards collection because reports of stress levels and happiness could underrepresent those of lower income, those living in dangerous areas, and victims of prejudice or abuse. Such factors, and many others, severely impact an individual's stress levels and could effect their response rate. Those living in a high stress environment may be less likely to respond to a questionnaire that touches on stress and happiness, either due to their personal time constraints, or because they do not feel comfortable disclosing such details, thus leaving certain demographics underrepresnted in the data. As such, it is possible for the collected data to be a byproduct of survey turnout rather than a true reflection of the mental health of students at UC San Diego, other UC colleges, and other US univerities. Accounting for these factors is necessary to ensure that the conclusions drawn from the data are accurate and ethical.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> From a pure ethics standpoint, it's important for the project to have a mechanism to allow for respondents to have their information removed from the study. This is because the responses being looked into pertains to sensitive topics an individual may not be 100% comfortable with touching upon in their responses. Thus, allowing respondents to have the ability to remove their data at any point helps them protect their privacy, but also gives them the comfort that they always have the choice to completely opt out at any time, and that their responses will not be permanently kept if the wish to have it removed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> There are many forms of bias that can sway the responses for one university one way, along with there being a completely different set of responses at another university simulataneously for a multitude of reasons. Along with trying to avoid things like confirmation bias, we need to pay close attention to if there is an imbalance of classes in the data we collect. Having sample that reflect the responses of the majority will not be an accurate representation of the other demographics that do not fall under the majority rule.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> One of the main goals to have our findings showcase accurate data with the purpose to inform. Thus, it's important (and ethical) for our project to be rid of biases, uncertainties, or any misformation that could distort the validity of the data in any way. If our conclusions are misleading or hide details for the sake of sounding better or looking more presentable, then that conclusion is not good to put out to the public since it obscures the truth of the question we are trying to answer, and could even lead to harm if someone chooses to act on that misinformation. \n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> The unfortunate reality is that students' perceptions of their own personal stress levels and happiness is heavily dependent on their living environment, and there is a possibility that the collected data will reflect this. Even if the more personal characteristics of someone's current living state will not be a point of emphasis, such factors can and will play a factor in their responses, which is a form of accidental discrimination that we have to be careful navigating around.\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> No model is perfect, and the same goes for this project. Like anything that has its shortcomings and uncertainties, it is important to disclose what ways the model is flawed, exploitable, or biased in any way. There are going to be certain cases and possibilities that the study cannot possibly cover, either because there is not a sufficient sample size, or because findings are unreliable. It's also completely possible that the findings might be subjected to bias that might not be apparent at a first glance, so making mention to that clearly to those who are trying to understand the data being presented helps keeps a good ethical standpoint with the message the data is trying to showcase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If users are harmed by the results, it is important that our team has a response plan, whether it be reworking the model in a way that avoids that unintentional harm in the future or temporarily shutting it down to avoid the spread of malice. This can be evaluated by studying the trend of student wellbeings after the study is posted. After a signficant time has passed, if there is a negative trend in overall student happiness across various United States universities that is not otherwise caused by a greater external factor that effects the entire population of university students (such as something akin to the COVID pandemic), we can determine that the findings did cause some harm and must either be pulled or reworked.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since this project seeks to analyze the sensitive topic of students' mental health in various universities in the United States, the potential for causing harm must closely be monitored. As such, if the analysis produces misleading conclusions, reinforces the stigma against marginalized groups, is heavily biased, or otherwise causes further psychological harm to anyone directly involved, continued use of the model should not be sustained. A clear roll back system or \"kill-switch\" would greatly serve as a safety net, since the model can be stopped at any time to avoid further harm, and tweaked to fix the mistakes in the current model, or rolled back to a version where the harm is no longer apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> We need to be weary of the potential of the model to be used for abuse, such as misconstruing the data to cause harm to those who are already in a high stress environment, or as negative propaganda that reinforces negative stereotypes. As such, it is essential to monitor any external use of the model and determine when various external use cases are intended for malicious purposes to avoid spreading misconduct or misinformation. "
