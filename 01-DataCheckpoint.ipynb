    "Students' mental health has become a central concern in the field of higher education, because psychological distress affects not only students' quality of life, but also their academic performance and their behaviors to seek help. To monitor indications such as depression symptoms, anxiety, stress, sense of belonging, and usage of counseling  service, campuses use standardized survey tools. However, different campuses measure mental health and well-being in different ways. As a result, we must carefully design metric selection and consider survey design variation, including sampling strategies, response rates and timing within a academic year, these are necessary for the studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will focus on asking how UCSD students' mental well-being and overall happiness compare to other UC campuses, other US universities, and univeristy internationlly. It can be framed as descriptive analysis(UCSD vs other UC campuses) and explanatory modeling(what student characteristics or campus conditions predict differences, after adjusting for confounders like student demographics, financial stress, or academic workload).\n",

    "One of the most widely used systems for comparing mental health status in US colleges and universities is the Healthy Minds Study (HMS).The study surveyed students at participating institutions and reported prevalence rates of mental health indicators, help-seeking behaviors, and demand for services.Results from HMS indicate that mental health challenges are common among US college students. More importantly, the study shows a consistent gap between the number of students experiencing mental health difficulties and the number who actually seek treatment. This suggests that differences between campuses may reflect variations in access to care, stigma, or awareness, rather than differences in mental health alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, prior work also notes that self-reported mental health measures may be influenced by response bias, campus culture, and differences in survey participation rates. As a result, higher reported prevalence at some campuses may reflect greater awareness or willingness to disclose symptoms rather than worse underlying mental health.\n",

    "\n",

    "For this project, we are not collecting our own survey data. Instead, we are using established campus and national survey sources that already measure student well-being using standardized questions. This matters for our research question because it lets us compare UC San Diego to other UC campuses and to broader U.S. benchmarks without inventing a new measurement scale.\n",

    "**1) Ideal dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, we would have a single dataset that includes multiple universities (UCSD, other UC campuses, and a wide range of U.S. schools) and measures mental well-being with the exact same survey items, administered during the same time window each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables we would want:**\n",
    "- Campus identifier (UCSD vs other UC campuses vs non-UC U.S. universities)\n",
    "- Well-being outcomes: self-reported stress, anxiety/depression indicators, self-reported happiness or life satisfaction, and sense of belonging\n",
    "- Help-seeking / resource use: whether a student used counseling/mental health services and perceived access/barriers\n",
    "- Timing variables: quarter/semester timing and survey administration window (so we can check whether “finals season” effects are showing up)\n",
    "- Basic controls: year in school, age range, gender (if available), major/college (if available), and financial stress indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many observations:**\n",
    "To make cross-campus comparisons stable, we would want at least a few hundred responses per campus, and ideally 1,000+ per campus when possible. If sample sizes vary by campus, we would prefer weighted estimates or to focus comparisons on campuses with enough responses to avoid noisy results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the data would be collected:**\n",
    "The cleanest design would be a standardized, anonymous online survey administered to representative samples across campuses at the same point in the academic year. Ideally, campuses would use the same validated scales so that differences reflect real student experiences rather than differences in survey wording.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the data would be stored/organized:**\n",
    "We would store the data in a tidy, tabular format where each row is one respondent and each column is one variable. If we only have campus-level summaries, the dataset would instead have one row per campus per year with summary statistics.\n",

    "**Healthy Minds Study (HMS), 2024–2025 National Data Report**\n",

    "\n",
    "**ACHA–NCHA (Spring 2025 reference summaries)**\n",
    "ACHA–NCHA provides standardized college health survey metrics across many institutions. We will use it for national and reference group comparisons. Important variables include mental health indicators and well-being measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UC Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES)**\n",
    "UCUES is designed specifically for cross-campus comparison within the UC system. This will be our primary dataset for comparing UCSD to other UC campuses on self-reported well-being and stress. We prioritize UCUES because it reduces measurement inconsistency across campuses.\n"

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [x] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We use data from surveys already conducted by universities or research organizations. Those surveys include their own consent process. We only use published or aggregated results and do not collect new responses\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "   \n",
    "    These surveys are voluntary, so students experiencing more stress or who care more about mental health may be more likely to respond. This could make distress appear higher than the true campus average.\n",
    " - [x] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "    Limit PII exposure: We are not using identifiable student data. The reports we reference are anonymized or aggregated. Our focus is on campus-level trends rather than individuals.\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "   \n",
    "      Self-reported surveys depend on perception and willingness to share. Differences across campuses may reflect awareness or stigma, not only actual mental health differences.\n",
    " - [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "      We will avoid exaggerating small differences and describe patterns rather than ranking campuses.\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [x] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "       We will cite all public sources so others can trace where numbers come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [x] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "      Any important patterns or trends found in the data or any observations that require extra justification will be appropriately addressed as needed.\n",
    " - [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "      We will make sure to communicate any limitations and biases found in the model and recognize that these shortcomings can greatly influence how results are interpreted.\n",
    "      We understand there are a series of confounding variables that can effect the self-reported responses or create biases in our findings and will ensure that these issues are clearly communicated to not over-generalize a certain population or demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [x] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "      We are aware of the possibility that this model may be used to pin blame on certain populations, organizations, or create unwarranted stereotypes or stigmas. We will seek to address this by making a normative statement for how the data should be perceived.\n"

    "Our main communicate mean will be discord and message, and the main working platform will be Github. We will share our work on Github and check in regularly, team message should be responsed within a reasonable timeframe. If needed, meeting will be scheduled that each member should attend or let the team know if they can't join.\n",

    "If there are conflicts or disagreement, we will address them respectfully, we will discuss it calmly as a group, and focus on solving it rather than blaming each other, and try to come out with a compromise that support the goal of the project. If needed, we will seek support and guidance from the course staff."
